Search pickings by the user that last processed them
====================================================
In the picking search view, you can type in the name of a user. The dropdown
will then allow you to search for pickings of a procurement group, any
picking of which was last processed by that user. These pickings are selected
by any moves that they contain that were last modified by this user (e.g.
because their status changed because of the processing).
