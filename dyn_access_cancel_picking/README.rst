Restrict access to Cancel buttons on pickings and waves
=======================================================
The Cancel button on picking and waves will be made
inaccessible to anyone except members of the system settings group.

Furthermore, the user needs to confirm his action after clicking the button.

With these measures, we want to prevent people inadvertently clicking these
buttons (instead of the 'Discard' link to ignore changes for instance).
